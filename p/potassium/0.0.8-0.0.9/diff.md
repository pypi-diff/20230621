-@app.async_handler("/async")
+@app.background("/background")
 def handler(context: dict, request: Request) -> Response:
 
     prompt = request.json.get("prompt")
     model = context.get("model")

-The `@app.async_handler()` decorated function runs a nonblocking job in the background, for tasks where results aren't expected to return clientside. It's on you to forward the data to wherever you please. Potassium supplies a `send_webhook()` helper function for POSTing data onward to a url, or you may add your own custom upload/pipeline code.

 When invoked, the client immediately returns a `{"success": true}` message.
 
-You may configure as many `@app.async_handler` functions as you'd like, with unique API routes.
-Note: Banana serverless isn't perfectly stable running async_handler. You can use it, but concurrency may be weird.
+You may configure as many `@app.background` functions as you'd like, with unique API routes.
 
+The `gpu=True` argument allows the background handler to access the prewarmed context value, and runs the child background thread as blocking. While the child thread is running, potassium will reject any other `gpu=True` handlers with a 423 Locked error, to ensure that there are no multithreading issues with CUDA. If set to `false`, the handler may be called at any time, but the context provided will be `None`. `gpu` defaults to `True`.

 ## app.serve()
 
 `app.serve` runs the server, and is a blocking operation.

+
+# Store
+Potassium includes a key-value storage primative, to help users persist data between calls. This is often used to implement patterns such as an async-worker queue where one background task runs inference and saves the result to the Store, with another handler set to `gpu=False` built to fetch the result.
+
+Example usage: your own Redis backend (encouraged)
+```
+from potassium.store import Store, RedisConfig
+
+store = Store(
+    backend="redis",
+    config = RedisConfig(
+        host = "localhost",
+        port = 6379
+    )
+)
+
+# in one handler
+store.set("key", "value", ttl=60)
+
+# in another handler
+value = store.get("key")
+```
+
+Example usage: using local storage 
+- Note: not encouraged on Banana serverless or multi-replica environments, as data is stored only on the single replica
+```
+from potassium.store import Store, RedisConfig
+
+store = Store(
+    backend="local"
+)
+
+# in one handler
+store.set("key", "value", ttl=60)
+
+# in another handler
+value = store.get("key")
+```
