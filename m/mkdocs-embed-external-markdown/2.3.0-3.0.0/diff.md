-- [x] Add ability to import content from private github repositories. Thanks to @sd0408
-- [x] Added support for multi level sections such as `### Section name` and `#### Section name`
-- [x] Better Handling of parsing makrdowns wich contains `#` in the content
-- [x] Failing Mkdocs Build when Markdown content cannot be fetched
+- [x] Modularized the code into separate methods for improved readability and maintainability.
+- [x] Added type hints for better code understanding and possible performance improvements.
+- [x] Included regex pre-compilation for performance enhancement.
+- [x] Enhanced URL validation to check for the structure of a URL rather than just the presence of .md.
+- [x] Improved error logging through the use of logger.warning instead of print statements, which integrates with MkDocs' logging system.
+- [x] Added handling for relative links in the markdown, making them absolute based on the base URL.
+- [x] Introduced better error handling for Connection Errors and Status Codes through optional return types.
+
+Removed:
+
+- [x] Removed the use of sys.exit(1) on error, allowing the MkDocs build process to continue even if the plugin encounters an issue.
+- [x] Removed the strict requirement for a section level at the beginning of a section name.
+      Changed
+- [x] Switched from using re.compile for one-time regex patterns to using re.match or re.search.
+- [x] Extracted the GitHub token once at the beginning of the request method instead of multiple times.
+- [x] Replaced the check for .md at the end of the URL with a more comprehensive regular expression to validate the URL's structure.
